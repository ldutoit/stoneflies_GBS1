Methods

[Sampling]
[Ibrary construction]

Libraries were sequenced on 2 lanes of IlluminaHiSeqXXX	 with a read length of 100bp.  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called using STACKS 2.0 (Catchen et al., 2013) without a reference genome with default parameters. Stacks (i.e. fragments) with more than 3 variable sites were excluded as potential collapsed repeats. Furthermore, a single SNP was selected for every fragment.
Finally, sites for which 80% of the samples were covered by at least one read were retained for population genomic analyses.

Results
Genotyping by sequencing of 166 individuals allowed us to identify 4663 variable sites.
